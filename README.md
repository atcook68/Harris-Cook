Creating a tictactoe game



There are 2 parts in the Team Project. We are going to start with an individual project (IP) and to finish as a team project (TP)
IP Description (Due by end of Module 6)
Each student is required to write a Tic-Tac-Toe (3x3) program. The student is going to build the classic game tic-tac-toe in Python. In this game, one player is X by a user and the other player (the computer) is O. You can imagine that the game will be played between you and the computer. Your program has the following requirements:

1. Selection of the first player
2. Assignment of "O" or "X"
3. Computer can select a position based on either random position. 
4. If computer can select a position based on an algorithm (e.g. MiniMax algorithm or rule-based) approach, you will earn 20 extra points.
5. At each run, the program should display the board (3x3) as shown below. Placement is made based on the pre-assigned positional number.
6. Your program prints appropriate message if there is a winner and then quits.
7. Your program saves all the moves between playersin a file called tictactoe.txt (X:5 O:2 X:1 O:9 etc...)
8. Your program should handle incorrect inputs (e.g. input validation) and continue to play without an error.

TP Description (Due by end of Module 10)
Upon finishing up the IP project, each student now selects a partner (could be 3 in total depending on the total number of students in the class). Each group is going to expand the 3x3 tic-tac-toe game into 5x5 tic-tac-toe game using object-oriented programming approach. The same guidelines and requirements applies to TP as described in IP above including the extra point for using an AI based algorithm. If there are 4 consecutive positions occupied by the same label ("X" or "O"), then you can declare as a winner.


1. Selection of the first player
2. Assignment of "O" or "X"
3. Computer can select a position based on either random position. 
4. If computer can select a position based on an algorithm (e.g. MiniMax algorithm or rule-based) approach, you will earn 20 extra points.
5. At each run, the program should display the board (5x5) as shown below. Placement is made based on the pre-assigned positional number.
6. Your program prints appropriate message if there is a winner and then quits.
7. Your program saves all the moves between players in a file called tictactoe.txt (X:5 O:2 X:1 O:9 etc...)
8. Your program should handle incorrect inputs (e.g. input validation) and continue to play without an error.
9. Your program should be designed using object oriented design and you should presents a class diagram as shown below.

TP Presentation (10-minute Video Clip)

In the video clip, one person will first present their object-oriented design including class diagrams and then the other person runs a demo while executing the code. Each presenter will have 5 minutes for their portion.
